#**Hello, World!**

Welcome to my Library System Management with Database Integration Application.

Overview:
This application is intended to involve user interactions to manage a database of Books, Authors, Users, and Borrowed Books for a library. The application will prompt the user and the user will use single digit responses to navigation the menu system. Once the user has used the menu system to select a specific action then the application will prompt the user to give some specific information that is used to process the action selected by the user. During any menu selection there is an option to shut down the application, this option is always the last option listed in the menu. 

Quick Tips:
1. In the menus use only single digit responses, no words, no more than 1 digit
2. Add the Author of a Book before you add the Book to the library
3. Try to give the information in the same format it is requested to be given in
4. If you make a selection and wish to go back to the main menu enter 0
